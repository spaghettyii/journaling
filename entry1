Title: Talking to People
Date: September 4th, 2025

  I can do this
  Ive done it before
  What have I done before?
  I need to be mindful
    What does that mean?
      Do I just agree?
      I should listen more
      I listen way too much
      Jokes are great ice breakers!
      They have feelings too
      I dont think I agree..
  I need to be myself
    What if they find me awkward
      I think everyone's cool except me
      They have things going on for them
      What am I even doing with my life?
      How often do I need to make eye contact
      Am I sitting too weirdly?
      My belly's too big
      Get me out of this shirt
      Why am I so sweaty
      Shit I forgot to listen
    Who even am I?
      I like things too moderately
      I should get a hobby and dive deeply
      They dont like the same things as me..
      I shouldnt just talk about smth they arent even interested in
      I don't know what they're talking about
      How can other people talk about something they dont know

  Am I just traumatized?
    Am I just making excuses?
      Am I being healthy?
        Am I just being whiny for no reason?
          I think I'm being unreasonable
            People don't make sense
              Is this even working for me?
                What am I looking for?
                  I should be more organized
                    Is it just my personality?
                      Is this normal?
                        Is anything normal?
                          
  I just think people are cool but that's not enough
