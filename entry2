Title: Goals for this year in the semester
Date: September 5th, 2025
Goal: to record and keep track of things I want to be doing this year

  I mentioned that I need to improve my social skills
  I have no meal plan
  I think I'll go look around and try to get my social skills working again
  I want to categorize how different events require different skillsets and how I interact with other people

  Event types:
    1. Club meetings
    2. Speaker Talks
    3. Friend Hangouts
    4. Climbing
