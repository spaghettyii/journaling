  I think I'm reinventing myself and want to capture these feelings
  This is just for my thoughts and want to invite anyone who wants to explore
  All of the things I add in this repository will be a form of self exploration not my entire whole but a part I want to keep dear to me
  Best of luck to me and let's make sure I remember to update this

  I want to practice getting to the point. My head is loopy and I can't seem to get a grasp of myself wheenver I want to think about anything

  P.S. I like using vim it makes my fingers happy
